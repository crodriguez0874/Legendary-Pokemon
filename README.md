# Legendary-Pokemon
Simulating the Pokemon generation process and applying machine learning methods to build the best classifier.

Hi,

This analysis is a toy project focused on simulating the Pokemon generation process and applying machine learning methods to build
the best classifier. Precisely, we are interested in classifying the legendary status of a given pokemon. There are many Kaggle
and DataCamp projects like this one, but what distinguished this project from the rest is that we simulate our own data. Instead of
using just the unique 809 (as of 07/16/19) pokemon as a training and test set, we mimic the pokemon generation process in the video games
to have a training and test set of 10,000 pokemon! This project has no significant real world applications, but it is a fun challenge
to keep the coding and statistical skills sharp!

The outline of the data project is as follows:

1) Data Generation

2) Exploratory Data Analysis

3) Feature Extraction

4) Tuning and Predictions Preparation

5) Predictions

6) Error Analysis

7) Report

This Github repository is designed to have a sub-repository for project milestones 1-6 and the original data. Each sub-repository
usually contains a .txt file with in-depth information on that milestone, .csv files of outputted data, .r/.py scripts pertaining
to the milestone, and a data folder with the data needed to run the .r/.py scripts.
