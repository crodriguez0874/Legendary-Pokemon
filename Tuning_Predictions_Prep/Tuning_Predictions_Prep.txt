In Tuning_Predictions_Prep.py, we generate the 8 pairs of training and test
sets that will be used by our prediction models. We segregate the sets of
features because they are all a projection of the same base stats data. The
eight pairs of data sets are described as follows:
    
* Original - The original data set.
    
* Total Aggregation - Add up all six base stats into one variable.

* Offensive/Defensive Aggregation - Add up HP, Defense, and Sp. Defense into 
one feature, and add up Attack, Sp. Attack, and Speed into another.
    
* PCA - The first 3 PC components.

* Polynomial-Kernal PCA - The first 3 PC components.

* RBF-Kernal PCA - The first 25 PC components.

* Cosine-Kernal PCA - The first 4 PC components.

* Isomap - Use the first 3 dimensions from the isomapping.

We also simplified our models to only consider the base stats (or some
aggregation/projection of them), height, weight, and gender. This way, the data
could follow a consistent format across the different sets and we could easily
automate tuning and predictions.

Next, we will tune and predict using machine learning methods. We will deploy:
    
* Lasso/Ridge Regression

* Linear/Kernal Support Vector Machines

* Random Forests

* Gradient Boosting

* K-Nearest Neighbor (new algorithm to learn)

Again, we want to automate this per pair of data sets. Ideally we would want a
script that tunes 1) tunes and predicts using the described methods and 2) out-
puts the model with the highest prediction accuracy on the test set and its
prediction accuracy. That way, we will have 8 'champion' models and we can 
then compare those between each other. Should look into a caret-esque method
on how to tune these models.
